## My process

The process was very simple, first I thought about the html structure, how I would fit every detail. In my mind I imagine I'm putting together a puzzle. Then just organize with css and then give colors and sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It's been a while since I developed on the frontend, but it's always good to remember some things about flexbox, it's a real hand on the wheel :)
